Script Description:

This script extracts all IP addresses from a Wireshark capture file (.cap file). This file is obtained through the Wireshark tool, which allows us to monitor and analyze network traffic.

Use Case:

The script proves beneficial when Wireshark is deployed in a network for the purpose of identifying suspicious network traffic. By extracting and presenting the IP addresses involved, it aids in pinpointing the origin of potentially unauthorized or malicious activity.
